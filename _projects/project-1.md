title: "Speaker Recognition From Degraded Audio Samples](http://iprobe.cse.msu.edu/project_detail.php?id=11&?title=Speaker_recognition_from_degraded_audio_samples)"
excerpt: "[In this project, we are working on developing deep learning-based algorithms for extracting robust speaker dependent voice characteristics from raw audio data and audio features, such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Linear Predictive Coding (LPC), for recognizing speakers in degraded audio samples.<br/><img src='/images/Project1_gphx.png'>"
