title: "[DeepTalk: Vocal Style Encoding for Speaker Recognition and Speech Synthesis](http://iprobe.cse.msu.edu/project_detail.php?id=20)"
excerpt: "Speaker recognition is the task of determining a person's identity from their voice. The human voice, as a biometric modality, is a combination of physiological and behavioral characteristics. The voice production system's physical traits determine the human voice's physiological characteristics, while the prosodic (pitch, timbre) and high-level (lexicon) traits impart the human voice's behavioral characteristics. In this work, we develop deep learning-based models for extracting speaker-dependent behavioral speech characteristics. These behavioral characteristics are then combined with speaker-dependent behavioral speech characteristics to improve speaker recognition performance in degraded audio signals. We further design a deep learning-based speech synthesis framework that uses these behavioral speech characteristics for generating highly realistic synthetic speech samples. <br/><img src='/images/Project2_gphx.png'>"
