title: "DeepTalk: Vocal Style Encoding for Speaker Recognition and Speech Synthesis](http://iprobe.cse.msu.edu/project_detail.php?id=20)"
excerpt: "[In this project, we are developing deep learning-based algorithms for extracting speaker-dependent behavioral speech characteristics for encoding a given speaker's vocal style. We further use the extracted behavioral speech characteristics for improving state-of-the-art speaker recognition and speech synthesis performance.<br/><img src='/images/Project2_gphx.png'>"
